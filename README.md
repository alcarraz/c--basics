# c++ basics series

This repository is for holding the sources of the basic c++ series that I'm posting in LinkedIn.

For now, each post is a new tag since I'm building on top o the previous. At some point it will be refactored in directories by topics.

## build & run.

```shell-session
$ make run
```
