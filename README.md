# c++ basics series

This repository is for holding the sources of the basic c++ series that I'm posting in LinkedIn.

Each directory has the content for a given day.

## build & run.
In each directory, just perform `make run` to build and run the example, of course you need make and g++ installed.

```shell-session
$ make run
```
